# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Python algorithms for MITx class

**Thoughts:** I am learning general computer science while working in Python.  Today I explored for- and while-loops. 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/amyngb/PythonAlgorithms (Week1Set1Problem1 and Problem2)

### Day 2: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created repository for a basic Google maps project.

**Thoughts**: Figured out more about how to use Github, and read through some Google tutorials.

### Day 3: June 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on another Python problem, gave push permission to 
@Rjgoolsby to help with my Maps project

**Thoughts**: I found a similar problem on Stack Overflow that helped a lot with the Python problem, but now I feel like I didn't solve it all on my own.  I spent a couple of hours on it over the weekend.  I guess I'm pretty new still with Python notation, and for-loops are still hard for me to understand how to use.  The more I work with them, the easier it will get, though!

### Day 4: June 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Python algorithms  

**Thoughts**: I'm finding that it's rather confusing to work in two different languages before I've mastered either (Python and JavaScript).  I might stop the Python course for now and then pick it back up once I've mastered JS...I wanna finish the "Guess my number" code first, though.

### Day 5: June 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Playing with JavaScript's array.filter() on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: Definitely dropping the Python course for now.  I can always come back to it when I'm not working 55 hours/week...Also, I want to master JavaScript before I learn my second language.  As a foreign languages teacher, I definitely understand that a second foreign language becomes much easier to learn after mastering a first.  (Of course, I also understand that there is not exact equivalency between spoken langauges and programming languages, but this analogy makes sense to me...:-)

### Day 5: June 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Seek and Destroy" and the "Where Do I Belong" algorigthms on FCC

**Thoughts**: Playing with JavaScript's array.filter() on Free Code Camp.  I had to look at a couple of solutions for the "Seek and Destroy" problem, and after reading that code, I was able to create my own solution.  I also learned about prototypes and the argument function here: https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCodeCamp/comments/3x85sh/clarification_on_syntax_for_creating_an_array_fo/cy2ffbp/.  The "Where do I belong?" algorithm was super easy after doing all the investigative work on "Seek and Destroy."  It only took about 15 minutes!

### Day 6: June 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked with "Caesar's Cipher" algorigthm on FCC

**Thoughts**: Was groggy from a nap.  Made it half-way thru the problem in an hour.

### Day 7: June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved "Caesar's Cipher" algorigthm on FCC

**Thoughts**: Learned about ASCII encoding, .charCodeAt() and String.fromCharCode() methods.

### Day 8: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started work on Random Quote Machine, with basic html and CSS.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit rusty on the HTML and CSS after weeks of JavaScript, so it's good to be coming back to it.

**Link(s) to work**: Haven't put it on Github yet (tomorrow!)

### Day 9: June 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read up on API keys on Maps project. 

**Thoughts**: Need to ask my mentor lots of things!

**Link(s) to work**: 

### Day 10: June 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Messed around with Random Quote generator. 

**Thoughts**: I feel stuck and not sure which direction I should go... :-(

### Day 11: June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed .gitignore issue with Maps project, fixed a link so my map would actually show up in the browser.

**Thoughts**: Used TeamViewer with my mentor, saw some command line work (I really need to learn that!).   Realized I need to learn about global objects and window variables in JS (I've really only been doing simple algorithms up to this point).  On Perfection: I missed several days last week since I was out of town on a conference.  Giving myself permission to continue with this challenge (even though I won't get credit for completing it perfectly) because it helps to have this goal of waking up at 5:30am and getting my hour of coding done before I start my day!

### Day 12: June 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Installed some useful packages on Atom.  Learned about objects on the CodingHeroes course.

**Thoughts**: I've narrowed my scope to deepen my understanding.  I'm definitely glad I'm committed to learning JS more fully before I move onto Python (or any other language).

### Day 13: June 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about objects on the CodingHeroes course.

**Thoughts**: Tutorial-only day.  I want to understand more before I continue coding.

### Day 14: June 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the execution stack and the scope chain on the CodingHeroes course.

**Thoughts**: Tutorial-only day.  I want to understand more before I continue coding.

### Day 14: July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned DOM manipulation through the CodingHeroes JavaScript course.

**Thoughts**: Finally starting to understand how it all (JS/HTML/CSS) comes together! 

**Link(s) to work**: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/

### Day 15: July 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about function constructors and Object.create.

**Thoughts**: I'm enjoying getting this theoretical base.  I think I'll be much more productive in my coding after this course.

### Day 16: July 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about first-class functions, IIFE's, closures and bind, call and apply methods.  I also coded a quiz game to be played in the browser console.

**Thoughts**: Try out my game!

### Day 17: July 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learned about overall project design and modules on my JavaScript course.

**Thoughts**: This stuff is very different from the algorithms I'd been doing before, but it is elegant and makes sense.

### Day 18: July 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Followed along in the app design process for my JavaScript course's budget app.

**Thoughts**: Saw event listeners in action, and learned more DOM manipulation.

### Day 19: July 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Followed along in the app design process for my JavaScript course's budget app.  

**Thoughts**: Learned that the node tree exists.

### Day 20: July 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Progressed on FCC's random quote machine. Used jsperf.com.   

**Thoughts**:  Had a problem with project design, but I figured it out with Reggie's help.  JSPerf is so cool-- my code lost horribly in a test runner against Reggie, but...at least it worked!

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/amyngb/Random-Quote-Generator/blob/master/js/quotes.js, https://jsperf.com/listbreaker2

### Day 21: July 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Random Quote Machine, put it up on CodePen.   

**Thoughts**:  Yay!
