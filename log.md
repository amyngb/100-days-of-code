# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Python algorithms for MITx class

**Thoughts:** I am learning general computer science while working in Python.  Today I explored for- and while-loops.

### Day 2: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created repository for a basic Google maps project.

**Thoughts**: Figured out more about how to use Github, and read through some Google tutorials.

### Day 3: June 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on another Python problem, gave push permission to 
@Rjgoolsby to help with my Maps project

**Thoughts**: I found a similar problem on Stack Overflow that helped a lot with the Python problem, but now I feel like I didn't solve it all on my own.  I spent a couple of hours on it over the weekend.  I guess I'm pretty new still with Python notation, and for-loops are still hard for me to understand how to use.  The more I work with them, the easier it will get, though!

### Day 4: June 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Python algorithms  

**Thoughts**: I'm finding that it's rather confusing to work in two different languages before I've mastered either (Python and JavaScript).  I might stop the Python course for now and then pick it back up once I've mastered JS...I wanna finish the "Guess my number" code first, though.

### Day 5: June 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Playing with JavaScript's array.filter() on Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: Definitely dropping the Python course for now.  I can always come back to it when I'm not working 55 hours/week...Also, I want to master JavaScript before I learn my second language.  As a foreign languages teacher, I definitely understand that a second foreign language becomes much easier to learn after mastering a first.  (Of course, I also understand that there is not exact equivalency between spoken langauges and programming languages, but this analogy makes sense to me...:-)

### Day 5: June 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved the "Seek and Destroy" and the "Where Do I Belong" algorigthms on FCC

**Thoughts**: Playing with JavaScript's array.filter() on Free Code Camp.  I had to look at a couple of solutions for the "Seek and Destroy" problem, and after reading that code, I was able to create my own solution.  I also learned about prototypes and the argument function here: https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCodeCamp/comments/3x85sh/clarification_on_syntax_for_creating_an_array_fo/cy2ffbp/.  The "Where do I belong?" algorithm was super easy after doing all the investigative work on "Seek and Destroy."  It only took about 15 minutes!

### Day 6: June 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked with "Caesar's Cipher" algorigthm on FCC

**Thoughts**: Was groggy from a nap.  Made it half-way thru the problem in an hour.

### Day 7: June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved "Caesar's Cipher" algorigthm on FCC

**Thoughts**: Learned about ASCII encoding, .charCodeAt() and String.fromCharCode() methods.

### Day 8: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started work on Random Quote Machine, with basic html and CSS.

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit rusty on the HTML and CSS after weeks of JavaScript, so it's good to be coming back to it.

**Link(s) to work**: Haven't put it on Github yet (tomorrow!)

### Day 9: June 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Read up on API keys on Maps project. 

**Thoughts**: Need to ask my mentor lots of things!

### Day 10: June 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**:  Messed around with Random Quote generator. 

**Thoughts**: I feel stuck and not sure which direction I should go... :-(

### Day 11: June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed .gitignore issue with Maps project, fixed a link so my map would actually show up in the browser.

**Thoughts**: Used TeamViewer with my mentor, saw some command line work (I really need to learn that!).   Realized I need to learn about objects in JS (I've really only been doing simple algorithms up to this point).
