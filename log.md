# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Python algorithms for MITx class

**Thoughts:** I am learning general computer science while working in Python.  Today I explored for- and while-loops.

### Day 2: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created repository for a basic Google maps project.

**Thoughts**: Figured out more about how to use Github, and read through some Google tutorials.

### Day 3: June 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on another Python problem, gave push permission to 
@Rjgoolsby to help with my Maps project

**Thoughts**: I found a similar problem on Stack Overflow that helped a lot with the Python problem, but now I feel like I didn't solve it all on my own.  I spent a couple of hours on it over the weekend.  I guess I'm pretty new still with Python notation, and for-loops are still hard for me to understand how to use.  The more I work with them, the easier it will get, though!

### Day 4: June 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More Python algorithms  

**Thoughts**: I'm finding that it's rather confusing to work in two different languages before I've mastered either (Python and JavaScript).  I might stop the Python course for now and then pick it back up once I've mastered JS...I wanna finish the "Guess my number" code first, though.
